# Image-Manipulation
The aim of this project is to manipulate the given images

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing techniques using OpenCV. It includes operations such as converting an image to grayscale, scaling, translating, flipping horizontally and vertically, inverting colors, and rotating by 45 degrees.

## Requirements

Python 3.8
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

## Usage

Place the script (image_processing.py) in the same directory as your images.
Update the script with the correct image file names.
Run the script (python image_processing.py).

## Operations Included

  > Gray Scale Image: Converts the input image to grayscale.
  > Gray Scale Image Scaled: Scales down the grayscale image by half.
  > Gray Scale Image Translated: Translates the grayscale image by 50 pixels both horizontally and vertically.
  > Gray Scale Image Flip Horizontal: Flips the grayscale image horizontally.
  > Gray Scale Image Flip Vertical: Flips the grayscale image vertically.
  > Gray Scale Image Invert: Inverts the colors of the grayscale image.
  > Gray Scale Image Rotate 45: Rotates the grayscale image by 45 degrees around its center.
  > Image Scale (Bonus): Scales down the input color image by half.
  > Image Translate (Bonus): Translates the input color image by 50 pixels both horizontally and vertically.
  > Image Flip Horizontal (Bonus): Flips the input color image horizontally.
  > Image Flip Vertical (Bonus): Flips the input color image vertically.

The processed images will be saved in the same directory with appropriate names.
